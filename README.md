# Luxonis-OAK-D
Software for testing of Luxonis OAK-D product family

## Important Notes
[Spatial Location Calculator software](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/samples/SpatialDetection/spatial_location_calculator/#spatial-location-calculator) tested with OAK-D Pro without laser gives accurate measurements above 317 mm distance. Far distances accuracy is not clear but nonetheless out of scope for current applications.
